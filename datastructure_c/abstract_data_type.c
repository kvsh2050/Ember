//ABSTRACT DATA TYPE 
// User defined created by programmer 
// this datatype is used by others to store-retrive data mainly 
// they can be implemented inside in various different methods! 
// but on the outside, they are having some common identified operations as listed below:


//Operations on abstrct data type 
// initialize 
// add/delete elements/data 
// seek or search()
// inserting 
// destroy - opposite of init 


//ADT EXAMPLES 

//LINKED LISTS
//TREE
//STACK 
//QUEUE
//GRAPH 
//HASH


//TRADE OFF
// speed 
// storage 


//SPACE AND TIME COMPLEXITY 
/*
1. time/speed/latency for any ADT operation 

2. space storage demand get/loose indicator as we do multiple ADT operations


3 types of classification of complexities: best, average, worst 

worst case -> big O notation

O(x):
1. O(1): constant time 
2. O(n): worst case search takes n steps for search operations in a abstract datatype
