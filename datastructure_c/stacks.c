STACKS 
: LIFO

1. push()
2. pop() : delete the data on top of stack 
3. peek()
4. traverse
5. find(value insode stack)

say 1-> 2->3->4 (4 is last)
then pop 4->3->2->1
Organization of stacks of plates 
-> can be represented as a linked list or other basic data structure like array / struct 
-> note linked list itself is a ADT made up of pointers and stack and dynamic allocation 


note:
we have top or head point to top element : we push before head 

stack :POINTERS:
1. top pointer 
2. last data is pointing to NULL
