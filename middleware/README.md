## Middleware in embedded systems 
1. Abstracts the OS and hardware for applications running on Embedded Systems 
2. It acts as a bridge, that simplifies complex hardware and ensures that mulitple software can run on the hardware reliability 
3. It can be part of 
    - system s/w layer 
    - os and middleware together 
    - device-driver and middleware 
4. middleware functions
    - expose API 
    - communication management 
    - resource management 
    - standardized interfaces 
    - security and safety 
5. Types of middleware elements:
    - Message Oriented middleware 
    - Object Request Brokers
    - Remote Procedure Calls
    - Database access, network protocols above device driver layer 
6. Broadly middleware classified into general purpose middleware and market specific middleware(standard based software, automative ecu)
